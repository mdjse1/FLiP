F L i P 3: Logical Framework
=====================================

**FLiP 3**, forked from the [FLiP repository] 
It's features include a natural deduction proof checker, as well as the ability to define your 
own logic/axioms.

The (unmet)goal of FLiP 3 is to convert to GUI from CLI, convert to python 3, and to
support logic systems that aren't currently included in the framework (to help avoid 
having to define your own logic).
