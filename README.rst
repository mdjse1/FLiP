F L i P 3: Logical Framework
=====================================

**FLiP 3** is a fork of `FLiP repository <https://github.com/jon-jacky/FLiP>`_ 

It's features include a natural deduction proof checker, as well as the ability to define your 
own logic/axioms. The (unmet) goals of FLiP 3 are to convert to GUI from CLI, convert it to python 3, 
and to add support for a few logic systems not currently included in the old framework.
