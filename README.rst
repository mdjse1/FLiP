F L i P 3: Logical Framework
=====================================

**FLiP 3** is a fork of `FLiP repository <https://github.com/jon-jacky/FLiP>`_ 

It's features include a natural deduction proof checker, as well as the ability to define your 
own logic/axioms. The (unmet) goal of FLiP 3 is to convert to GUI from CLI, convert to python 3, and to
support logic systems that aren't currently included in the framework (to help avoid 
having to define your own logic).
